To execute customizable python plugins...
	1) Create a python script with the following properties:
		a) The script contains one or more functions for tcpflow usage.
		b) Each intended function must take a single, string parameter. This parameter will hold the contents of the application data captured by tcpflow.
		c) Each intended function must return a string, which will then be added to the report.xml file with the "plugindata" tag.
	2) Add the script to the tcpflow/python/plugins directory.
	3) Execute the script by passing "<FileName>::<FunctionName>" to tcpflow with the "-P" option.

Example Usage:
	
	./src/tcpflow -r samplePcaps/jpegs.cap -o flows -P samplePlugin::sampleFunction
